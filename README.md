# Predictions-in-Machine-Learning


This repository exhibits all the frequently used prediction models in Machine Learning with an increasing figure of accuracy.
1)Employerâ€™s Salaries: The salary of each employer is predicted on basis of the number of years of working experience of that particular employer using Simple Linear Regression.

2)Startups: The prediction of the profit in each startup is calculated on basis of the investments made in various sectors using Multiple Linear Regression.

3)Position Salaries: This uses Regression to negotiate and predict the future salary of a new employee of a company using Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression individually.

4)Social Network Ads: This uses classification to classify which user will buy a particular product depending on his age, salary and the product price using Logistic Regression, K-NN, Support Vector Machine, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification and Random Forest Classification individually.

5)Mall Customers: This uses Clustering to segment the clients into different groups based on their Spending Score and Annual Income using K-means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering individually.

6)Market Basket Optimisation: This uses Associative Rule Learning to predict that if a customer buys product A, what is the likelihood that he also buys product B. We use Apriori to compute the likelihood.

7)Marketing Campaign: This uses Reinforcement Learning to prepare a Marketing Campaign. Here, we create many ads of a particular product in different versions and to predict which version of the ad will have the highest Click Through Rate. We use Upper Confidence Bound and Thompson_Sampling individually.

8)Restaurant Reviews: Here we predict whether a review given by a customer for a restaurant is positive or negative, i.e. whether the review is good or bad by processing the language of the reviews. We use Natural Language Processing to achieve this.

9)Churn Modelling: This uses deep learning to predict whether a customer stays or leaves the bank on basis of various factors. We use Artificial Neural Networks.

10)Dimensionality Reduction Here we classify a number of customers into different segments on basis of their tastes for wines and the clinical information about the different components of wine is also provided. This uses PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS and LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS individually.
